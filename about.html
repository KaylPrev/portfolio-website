                I am currently in my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh. I moved to the city from
                rural Pennsylvania and have been writing about my roots ever since. During my past semester,
                I have won a Taube Award in Fiction for my short story ‘Roadside Crosses’ (working on getting
                this out soon so you can read it!).

                I often write short fiction that’s a mix of analytical, surreal, somewhat political, and nostalgic.
                Using my film minor, I love to shoot analog photography to give visuals to my writing. When I’m not
                writing
                or taking pictures, I am usually watching a good movie on my couch, reading, cooking, or spending time
                out
                with my friends.
