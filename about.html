                I am currently in my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh. I moved to the city from
                rural Pennsylvania and have been writing about my roots ever since. During my past semester,
                I have won a Taube Award in Fiction for my short story ‘Roadside Crosses’ (working on getting
                this out soon so you can read it!).

                I often write short fiction that’s a mix of analytical, surreal, somewhat political, and nostalgic.
                Using my film minor, I love to shoot analog photography to give visuals to my writing. When I’m not
                writing
                or taking pictures, I am usually watching a good movie on my couch, reading, cooking, or spending time
                out
                with my friends.

                Saint Charles Cemetery in Twin Rocks, Pennsylvania. I used to go here to walk around to look at graves or sit
                 in my car with all the windows down and take in the quietness. There’s graves that date back to the late 1800s
                  and ones that are still being put in place.</p>

                A lone deer in the fields during sunset. This was most likely taken in Colver, Pennsylvania. I used to and still
                 drive around these backroads for hours. It’s a little town that’s surrounded by fields.

                A dirt road, also in Colver. Nearby is an older farm house and in the far distance, out of frame in this photo,
                 is the Colver Green Energy power plant that lights up the rural skyline at night.
