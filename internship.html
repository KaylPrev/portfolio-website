                During the summer of 2025, I had the incredible experience of interning at Pie Press Publishing,
                located in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. I learned so much about the publishing and writing world. My
                time here was spent doing an abundance of different things, such as making social media graphics
                that promoted StoryBundles, short stories, and podcast episodes, working with the software Vellum
                to update ebooks, creating a story bible for an upcoming novel, and doing research for a few
                different topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                My favorite task I did while interning was research on the 1977 Johnstown flood, which will be used in
                an upcoming theatrical project by my supervisor. Johnstown is a short drive from my hometown, and it’s
                often referenced by other people when I try to explain where my hometown is.
            </p>
            <p>
                “About 20 minutes north of Johnstown.”
            </p>
            <p>
                “Oh yeah, the place with the floods.”
            </p>
            <p>
                I have grown up hearing stories from my family about how the 1977 flood impacted them. The entire area
                was in
                turmoil from the natural disaster. I got my hands on original newspapers that date back to the flood in
                July 1977
                from my grandparents, who kept them wrapped in plastic and stored them in their basement all these
                years. I was
                able to pull information from them for this research task, and I loved it. It felt particularly
                personal, an
                honor almost, to be reading a list of names of those who died in the flood from the same newspapers my
                grandparents held when reading that same list.
            </p>

                Below are some pictures from the newspapers from that week in 1977, including ads from the department
                stores
                that are long gone, the movies played at the drive-ins, the television schedule, and an editorial for
                Johnstown.
